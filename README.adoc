= Introduction
Live coding support of my `Property tests: Write fewer tests, find more bugs` talk.

* Each class' name is the type of property we can find on such code. Of course this is not exhaustive.
* The test files contain both classical unit tests (annotated with `@Test`) as well as property tests (annotated with `@Property`).

== Build
```
./gradlew build
```
Runs all tests.
